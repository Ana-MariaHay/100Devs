    <div>
        div is the standard block-level element.
        A block-level element starts on a new line and
        stretches out to the left and right as far as
    <span> like this </span>
        it can. Other common block-level elements are
        p and form, and new in HTML5 are header, footer,
        section, and more.

    <div id="main">
        Using max-width instead of width in this situation will improve the browser's handling of small windows. This is important when making a site usable on mobile. Resize this page to check it out!
        
        By the way, max-width is supported by all major browsers including IE7+ so you shouldn't be afraid of using it.

    <div class="static">
        static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned. 
        relative works the same way as static unless some other properties are added
    </div>
    <div class="relative2">
        Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.

    <div class="fixed">
        Hello! Don't pay attention to me yet.
    </div>
    <div class="relative">
        This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body. 
        <div class="absolute">
            This element is absolutely-positioned. It's positioned relative to its parent.
